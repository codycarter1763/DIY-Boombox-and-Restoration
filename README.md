# About My Boomboxes
I design and fabricate custom-made boomboxes tailored to customers' specific desires not found on the market. Originally started as a way to fuse my love of music with technology as a kid, quickly turned into a very rewarding and successful venture with many different models and iterations for various applications. This repo contains my story, parts lists, design aspects and iterations, and additional information for anyone to pursue a truly unique project!

## First Iterations
When I was 12, I decided to take on a challenge and design my own boombox from the ground up. Having no clue what I was doing, I referenced a lot of websites and helpful Youtube videos that helped with my intuition on how everything connects together. Most if not all parts came from a scrap bin somewhere that I repurposed into a system. This initial build featured:
- Bluetooth
- Full-range stereo audio with woofer, midrange, and tweeters
- 3.5mm aux input for wired connections
- Lithium battery for 6 hours of continuous playback

I faced many challenges for this build, but after a lot of trial and error came a very useable and capable boombox that really motivated me to keep pursuing technology as a career.

## After Development and Experience 
Building off of the experience I gained from my first boombox build, I started incorporating Autodesk Fusion for CAD, CNC machining, and audio physics with WinISD for the highest fidelity and consistent audio quality. After multiple iterations, commissions started to gain traction from people who wanted a fully custom speaker system with aspects not found on the market. Notable builds include:
- Studio monitor systems for mastering music in a recording studio and band hall
- Desktop speakers for high-fidelity audio quality
- Portable boomboxes for parties and outdoor use

# Restoration Of A Previous Build
Between the fabrication of my first boombox and the standard models shown above, I experimented with making a portable boombox with advanced features to see whether it would be worth pursuing. Features include:
- JVC KD-RD99BTS stereo reciever for highly customizeable audio
- 200W of Class D amplifier power
- Full range hi-fi audio
- Carefully sized box with WinISD for optimum subwoofer performance
- Precision fabricated with CNC machining
- Motorized AM/FM antenna for automatic raising/lowering
- Guitar input
- Microcontroller for custom RGB lighting

While this speaker system did work, there were certain issues like air leaks, size of enclosure, radio battery charging, and ease of use that steered me to make Bluetooth-only speaker systems after this one. As a result, I just used this speaker system as a project box, where I can try out different speaker setups, features, tunings, and really anything else to potentially make into a new model.

Fast forward to the present, I decided to take this speaker system out of retirement and make it into a very useable and functional boombox to bring with me to tailgates. Several improvements were made to the original design and ended up being my favorite boombox that I have made thus far. These improvements include:
- New lead-acid battery and charger for radio setting backup
- High-excursion subwoofer visualized with WinISD for deeper bass with the same box size
- Cleaned up and simplified wiring
- Downsized 200 watt amp to a 100 watt amp, ended up being just as loud with the same percieved volume without distortion
- Resealed speaker enclosure with new foam strips to prevent air leaks
- Disconnected the guitar input

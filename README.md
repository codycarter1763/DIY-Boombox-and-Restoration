# About My Boomboxes
I design and fabricate custom-made boomboxes tailored to customers' specific desires not found on the market. Originally started as a way to fuse my love of music with technology as a kid, quickly turned into a very rewarding and successful venture with many different models and iterations for various applications. This repo contains my story, parts lists, design aspects and iterations, and additional information for anyone to pursue a truly unique project!

## First Iterations
When I was 12, I decided to take on a challenge and design my own boombox from the ground up. Having no clue what I was doing, I referenced a lot of websites and helpful Youtube videos that helped with my intuition on how everything connects together. Most if not all parts came from a scrap bin somewhere that I repurposed into a system. This initial build featured:
- Bluetooth.
- Full-range stereo audio with woofer, midrange, and tweeters.
- 3.5mm aux input for wired connections.
- Lithium battery for hours of continuous playback.

I faced many challenges for this build, but after a lot of trial and error came a very useable and capable boombox that really motivated me to keep pursuing technology as a career.

## After Development and Experience 
After multiple iterations, commissions started to gain traction from people who wanted a fully custom speaker system with aspects not found on the market.
